PS3 code based for ECML-PKDD paper<br>

requirements :<br>
python = 3.6<br>
scikit-learn<br>
nltk<br>
pandas <br>
numpy <br>

For simplicity we used jupyter notebook and use Founta dataset as it represent the most skewed dataset. <br>
we run the experiment 10 times and take the average for the report in the paper. <br>

For the experiment such as in Figure 3 (in the paper), please modify the dataset to have similar ratio as in the paper <br>
